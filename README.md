My personal website


The domain is [mitch-hansen.com](http://www.mitch-hansen.com/), and it may or may not be up as I recently bought a server from my former high school and have been setting it up over the past month with my younger brother. We need a more permanent location to set it up with access to ethernet before keeping it on 24/7.
